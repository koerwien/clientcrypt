A minimalistic set of routines that allow password based client-side encryption of data before it is being sent to a remote server. Encryption is based on the tweetnacl routines. Encryption and decryption use a private key that is computed from a given password and never leaves the client. It should be stored in the client's browser's localstorage (upon login with the given password) and should be removed from there upon logout.
